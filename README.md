  A <a href="https://www.gnome.org/challenge/">GNOME Challenge 2020 </a> project that aims to bring, engage, and retain new contributors to the open source community.
</div>
<br/>
FOSSDorm is a free and open source platform to help newcomers find open source projects based on their skill preference, then learn how to contribute to the selected project, and engage them for the long term.
<br/>
To achieve the same target, FOSSDorm aims to fulfills three basic needs:

1. <strong>Where to find skill-based suitable project:</strong> GitHub is a large ocean where new contributors find hard to search for project meeting their demands. Hence, FOSSDorm provides a list of all verified and approved (by us) open source projects.
2. <strong>How to contribute:</strong> Even after finding a project, contributors sometimes fail to engage with the community due to lack of good documentation for beginners. Hence, each project on FOSSDorm contains a separate page providing all informations about the project, how to set up a project at localhost, guide for contribution, and how to stay in touch with the community.
3. <strong>How to engage contributors forever:</strong> FOSSDorm also has reward system that helps contributors build their profile displaying the amount of open source contribution they've done to the projects listed at FOSSDorm.
