  A <a href="https://www.gnome.org/challenge/">GNOME Challenge 2020 </a> project that aims to bring, engage, and retain new contributors to the open source community.

<br/>
It is a free and open source platform to help newcomers find open source projects based on their skill preference, then learn how to contribute to the selected project, and engage them for the long term.

## Why FOSSDorm?

FossDorm aims to bring new contributors to the open source community and engage them forever. To achieve the same target, the app fulfills three basic needs:

1. Where to find my skill-based suitable project: GitHub is a large ocean where new contributors find hard to search for project meeting their demands. Hence, this app has a section listing all verified and approved open source project.
2. How to contribute: Even after finding a project, contributors sometimes fail to engage with the community. Documentation for beginners is one of the main reasons. Hence, each project in this app will contain a must-have page providing a minimum of three details in both text and video format. That is, about the project, how to set up a project and get started, and how to stay in touch with the community.
3. How to engage contributors forever: Contributors need to manually paste their merged code link into the app to get a reputation point or badges. This will encourage and also build their profile displaying the amount of open source contribution.
